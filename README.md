# PyTorch-DeepFloorplanRussia

This is a working code repository for the Bachelor's Degree Final Research Project "Floor Plan Generation Using Deep Learning Methods" by Artemiy Ermilov.

This research project introduces an improved floor plan generation framework inspired by the Deep Floor Plan Recognition framework by Zeng et al. 

Additionally, a new floor plan segmentation dataset is created and labeled as a part of this work. The dataset can be downloaded using from Google Drive: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bWou0Uuz5fQjsSik6uB5nzGhoXEjQiQK/view?usp=share_link).
