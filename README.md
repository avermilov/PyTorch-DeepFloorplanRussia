# PyTorch-DeepFloorplanRussia

This is a working code repository for the Bachelor's Degree Final Research Project "Floor Plan Generation Using Deep Learning Methods" by Artemiy Ermilov.

This research project introduces an improved floor plan generation framework inspired by the Deep Floor Plan Recognition framework by Zeng et al. 

Additionally, a new floor plan segmentation dataset is created and labeled as a part of this work. The dataset can be downloaded from Google Drive: [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bWou0Uuz5fQjsSik6uB5nzGhoXEjQiQK/view?usp=share_link).

The weights of the best model can be downloaded from Google Drive: [model weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H1G7NZ1j6AL1zrsJKFUFAP0NRdnFmtMt/view?usp=sharing)

This repository is a work-in-progress and detailed instructions for training and inferencing models, as well as labeling and using your own data, will be added **upon paper publication**.

If you encounter any problems with running the code or downloading the dataset, feel free to open an issue!
